Data Science has brought marvelous opportunities to many industries, and tourism is no exception. Although tourism is known as an interdisciplinary field that crosses sociology, economics, geography, psychology, and communication sciences, tourism researchers have long been constrained by the classical repertoire of research methodologies. Besides the widely applied quantitative and qualitative approaches, we could see advancements especially in quantitative methods over time. In an era of digitization, data comes in new unstructured forms along with traditionally structured datasets, which result in the rise of Big Data. Meanwhile, advancements in computing and the rapid development of algorithms lead to the emergence of advanced analytics that goes beyond conventional business intelligence to gain deeper insights and make predictions. Data Science is more than a set of methods and tools in elevating the typical ways of doing empirical research, allowing researchers to even find answers for previously unknown questions. However, Data Science is yet to be embraced by tourism scholars potentially because of the bigness, messiness, and unstructured nature of data that fuel confusion and uncertainty. At the same time, because Data Science has altered the epistemological foundations, the interplay between Data Science and theory deserves much attention.

By learning how to develop research questions that can be supported by theories, Data Science helps researchers better understand the data, uncover unknown relationships and patterns, and improve data visualization. In tourism, examples of Data Science applications include route optimization, real-time analysis, predictive analysis, personalization, customer sentiment analysis, alerting and monitoring systems, and much more. Nevertheless, adopting Data Science in tourism is not an easy task as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding between computer sciences as its original discipline. Tourism researchers are often not aware of these upcoming techniques and not familiar with their usage, contributions, advantages, pitfalls, and limitations.

This book is intended to serve as a starting point that connects Data Science to the tourism industry, being helpful for both, researchers and practitioners alike. It aims to present an overview of Data Science techniques relevant for tourism by offering a theoretical foundation for these concepts and a how-to-approach which facilitates readers in developing their research projects. Of course, this book cannot claim to cover the individual chapters and topics in their completeness. Rather, the aim is to provide the reader with the necessary knowledge to facilitate the decision regarding the choice of method.
